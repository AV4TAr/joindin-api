# joindin-api

This is the API behind the joind.in website (the new version of it), the mobile applications, and many other consumers.  This project is a dependency for the majority of the other projects under the joind.in organization https://github.com/joindin


## Quick Start

 * point a new virtual host at the public directory, one level below this file.
 * copy `src/database.php.dist` to `src/database.php` in your joind.in installation; if you have the website project installed too, these files are the same and you may copy or symlink.
 * generate some sample data 
 * the mbstring extension is required.

## How to use the API

Go to http://api.joind.in and click around!
